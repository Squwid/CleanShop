# Clean Shop

### Description: CleanShop is a Minecraft shop Plugin that uses Gold as currency. It is a command based shop with a buy/sell market that allows players to buy and sell items with each other. 
### Version: 1.0.0 Optimized for **Bukkit 1.12.2** **(CURRENTLY SUPPORTS UUID)** 

#
#### About: This plugin is free to use and fork to create any changes that need to be made. Download the `.jar` if you are unsure on how to modify and compile the code, and drag into plugins folder and run the server. Simple as that. 
#
#### Usage: All items on the market and player gold amounts are stored in a `.yml` file that is saved once the plugin is started for the first time.
#
## Commands: 
```
All Players

## TODO's: 
1. Add Transaction logs every time a transaction takes place.
2. Add "reset" support rather than just deleting all files.
3. Add permissions to allow players to use the market
4. Add settings file that allows for server hosts to modify some settings in the shop
